The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) annually, engaging over 400,000 Americans to collect
data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and the use of preventive
services. Utilizing the 2015 BRFSS data, this report explores significant predictors of
diabetes by analyzing 22 variables through various statistical methods. We employed five
baseline methods and two advanced ensemble techniques, focusing on parameter optimization
through cross-validation. Among the baseline methods, Logistic Regression emerged
as the most effective, demonstrating the lowest error rates. Random Forest, among all the
methods, provided highly accurate predictions, outperforming other tested methods. This
analysis underscores the efficacy of combining traditional and contemporary statistical approaches
in predicting health outcomes.
